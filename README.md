# Aadhaar Voting
Aadhaar Based voting system using blockchain technology
Project implemented as part of Rajasthan Hackathron

## Description

* The authority must login first with the provided session ID.
* The voter can now begin the process of voting with proper authentication through OTP(one time password) on the respective linked mobile number.
* If the voter is valid then the system will check for for the voters age and the address to which he can give vote.
* the voting pallete will be opned with  candidate names,their parties and logos.
* Now the voter can give his vote by clicking vote button.
* one voter can give his vote only once,i.e after one time voting buttons are disabled and the vote is automatically loged out.
* Same process continiues for many more votters irrespective of their voting wards.

### Purpose of test

 * The authority login is to ensure security to prevent piracy,harresment and corruption from candidates standing in election.
 * OTP generation is to authenticate the right aadhar card owner.
 * button disabling and automatic logout is to prevent multiple voting by single candidate.
